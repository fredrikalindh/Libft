En dator behöver följande information för att fungera på ett nätverk:
IP-adress
Subnätmask
IP-adressen till en Default Gateway (router)
IP-adressen till minst en DNS-server

IP address: Internet Protocol Address aka logical address is a unique identifier for each device on the internet assigned by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Lenght is 32-bits giving 2^32 possible addresses. The first part shows which network the device is connected. to.

A netmask is a 32-bit binary mask used to divide an IP address into subnets and specify the network's available hosts. In a netmask, two bits are always automatically assigned. For example, in 255.255.225.0, "0" is the assigned network address. In 255.255.255.255, "255" is the assigned broadcast address. The 0 and 255 are always assigned and cannot be used.

What is the subnet of an IP with Netmask? it is the parts corresponding with 255.

What is the broadcast address of a subnet - 0

What are the different way to represent an ip address with the Netmask: 255.255.255.0 / 255.255.0.0 / 255.0.0.0

What are the difference between public and private IPs. Some of the IP addresses are reserved for so called private IPs. It's so that they can be used in multiple places. All adresses starting with ten, 172.16 - 172.31 and 192.168 (most common with 192.168.0 / 192.168.1) They can't be used online, just on LAN. To go online you need NAT, network address translation.

What is a class of IP address

What is TCP

What is UDP

What are the network layers

What is the OSI model

What is a DHCP server and the DHCP protocol? Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, is a protocol/way of automatically handing out configurations to the devices on the network. Normally the router is prepared to hand out addresses via DHCP so that they are on the same IP-network/subnet(?) as its own LAN IP-address. When a computer is connected to a network it asks for an IP Address by sending a DHCP request asking if there is a DHCP server on the network. Is so it asks for the necessary details (IP, subnet, default gateway, DNS)

What is a DNS server and the DNS protocol: DNS = Domain Name System, a system to translate between IP-addresses and DNS name aka domains. DNS consists of a number of servers on the internet that can answer to questions about domain names.

What are the rules to make 2 devices communicate using IP addresses

How routing is working with IP

What is a default gateway for routing. It's what's connecting the devices on the LAN with the WAN and the internet through the router.

What is a port from an IP point of view and what is it used for when connecting to an other device?

Because most devices have an IP Address starting with 192.168 they need NAT (Network Address Translation). The router that has a public IP use that when forwarding the information from the hosts.
