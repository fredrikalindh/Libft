IP address: Internet Protocol Address aka logical address is a unique identifier
for each device on the internet assigned by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
Lenght is 32-bits giving 2^32 possible addresses. The first part shows which network the device is connected. to.

A netmask is a 32-bit binary mask used to divide an IP address into subnets and specify the network's available hosts. In a netmask, two bits are always automatically assigned. For example, in 255.255.225.0, "0" is the assigned network address. In 255.255.255.255, "255" is the assigned broadcast address. The 0 and 255 are always assigned and cannot be used.

What is the subnet of an IP with Netmask? it is the parts corresponding with 255.

What is the broadcast address of a subnet - 0

What are the different way to represent an ip address with the Netmask: 255.255.255.0 / 255.255.0.0 / 255.0.0.0

What are the difference between public and private IPs. Some of the IP addresses are reserved for so
called private IPs. It's so that they can be used in multiple places. All adresses starting with ten, 172.16 - 172.31 and 192.168. They can't be used online, just on LAN. To go online you need NAT, network address translation.
